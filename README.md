# k-kdesvn

Commands for managing my checkout of the KDE Subversion repository.

I use Git locally to track local changes.

There is `k-kdesvn log` which is like `svn log` except Scripty is excluded, so that I'm actually able to see changes from other translators, as well as changes made directly to the translation repository.
